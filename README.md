This repo records my answers to all questions from the excercises of CS229
(Autumn 2017). http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

I tried to record all details in Jupyter notebooks. If you see mistakes, please
let me know.

As for reinforcement learning, I've also implemented value iteration, policy
iteration, SARSA, and Q-learning  before in javascript for the gridworld at
https://github.com/zyxue/rljs with a web demo at https://rljs.herokuapp.com/.

You might also be interested in an earlier version of cs229,

This project is considered complete.
